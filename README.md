# Payload Dependencies Graph Observer Plugin

This plugin creates a dependency graph between collections and globals. The graph updates automatically, because the plugin observes the changes made on any collection or globals.

## Use Cases

The plugin is useful when it comes to cached content or relationship-based changes.

```shell
yarn add payload-dependencies-graph
# OR
npm i payload-dependencies-graph
```

## Tests

Tests are using Jest, to run the tests use:

```shell
npm run test
```
