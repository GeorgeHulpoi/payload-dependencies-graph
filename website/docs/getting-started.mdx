description: How to install and use Payload Dependency Graph Plugin
---

# Getting Started

## Installation

:::caution

The major version of the plugin must match the major version of the Payload.

:::

```bash npm2yarn
npm install payload-dependency-graph
```

## Configuration

In the `plugins` array of your [Payload config](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/overview), call the plugin with [options](#plugin-options):

```ts title="src/payload.config.ts"
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config';
import { DependencyGraphPlugin } from 'payload-dependency-graph';

const config = buildConfig({
	// ... rest of your config
	plugins: [DependencyGraphPlugin()],
});

export default config;
```

### Plugin Options

Plugin Options are available [here](/docs/api/interfaces/DependencyGraphPluginConfig).

#### Factory

By default, the plugin uses the [InMemoryDependencyGraph](/docs/api/classes/InMemoryDependencyGraph), but you can use another way to manage dependencies as long as you extend the [DependencyGraphBase](/docs/api/classes/DependencyGraphBase) class. You can do this using the [factory](/docs/api/interfaces/DependencyGraphPluginConfig#factory) property.

If you're dealing with a lot of documents, a better approach is to use a database-oriented implementation because the in-memory approach will increase the RAM. In the next versions, the plugin will provide it by default for MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

#### Editor Extractor

Rich Text Fields can have relationships with other documents. The only problem is that the Payload Editor is highly customizable, therefore you can have editor features that use relationships. This can be difficult to extract relations for several reasons:

-   You cannot extract an exact schema of what is in Rich Text.
-   From **Payload 2.x.x** you can choose the editor you want to use, meaning that the structure of the value can differ.

Therefore [editorExtractor](/docs/api/interfaces/DependencyGraphPluginConfig#editorextractor) is a function that gives you the ability to parse the Rich Text value and extract its dependencies.

:::info

If you are using **Payload 2.x.x**, you should be aware that each Rich Text field can customize its editor settings. In response, I added the option to customize the EditorExtractor for each field.

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types';
import { lexicalEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical';

export const Pages: CollectionConfig = {
	slug: 'pages',
	fields: [
		{
			name: 'content',
			type: 'richText',
			editor: lexicalEditor({
				// ... your settings
			}),
			custom: {
				editorExtractor: (args) => {
					// ... your editor extractor implementation
				},
			},
		},
	],
};
```

:::

##### Example

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config';
import { DependencyGraphPlugin } from 'payload-dependency-graph';

const extract = async (nodes: any[], source, dependencyGraph) => {
	for (let node of nodes) {
		if ('children' in node) {
			await extract(node.children);
		} else if (node.type === 'image') {
			await dependencyGraph.addDependency(source, {
				collection: node.collection,
				id: node.doc.id,
			});
		}
	}
};

const config = buildConfig({
	// ... rest of your config
	plugins: [
		DependencyGraphPlugin({
			editorExtractor: async ({ source, value, dependencyGraph }) => {
				await extract(value, source, dependencyGraph);
			},
		}),
	],
});

export default config;
```

## Usage

The utility of this plugin lies in listening to events on collections or globals and determining resource dependencies.

### Listening

If you want to listen for changes, call the [subscribe](/docs/api/classes/DependencyGraphServiceImpl#subscribe) from [DependencyGraphService](/api/overview#dependencygraphservice). The `DependencyGraphService` is a singletone instance.

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config';
import { DependencyGraphPlugin, DependencyGraphService } from 'payload-dependency-graph';

const config = buildConfig({
	// ... rest of your config
	plugins: [DependencyGraphPlugin()],
	onInit: (payload) => {
		DependencyGraphService.subscribe((event) => {
			// write your own logic
		});
	},
});

export default config;
```

### Determine Dependencies

To determine if a resource is a dependency for another resource use the [dependencyGraph](/docs/api/classes/DependencyGraphServiceImpl#dependencyGraph) from [DependencyGraphService](/api/overview#dependencygraphservice):

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config';
import { DependencyGraphPlugin, DependencyGraphService } from 'payload-dependency-graph';

const config = buildConfig({
	// ... rest of your config
	plugins: [DependencyGraphPlugin()],
	onInit: (payload) => {
		DependencyGraphService.subscribe((event) => {
			if (event.type === 'update' && event.collection) {
				const graph = DependencyGraphService.dependencyGraph;
				const resource = {
					collection: event.collection,
					id: event.doc.id,
				};

				if (event.collection === 'pages' && event.doc.id === 'home') {
					// regenerate home page
				} else {
					if (
						graph.isDependency(
							{
								collection: 'pages',
								id: 'home',
							},
							resource,
						)
					) {
						// regenerate home page
					}
				}
			}
		});
	},
});

export default config;
```
